# Virtualized Network Design & Implementation with SDN, NFV, Automation, and Redundancy

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a **virtualized network architecture** using **Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), automation, and redundancy**. The goal is to create a **scalable, flexible, and fault-tolerant** network infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Implement **SDN** for centralized network control.
- Utilize **NFV** to deploy virtualized services (firewalls, load balancers, VPNs).
- Automate network configuration using **Python/Ansible**.
- Apply **redundancy techniques** to ensure high availability.
- Test and validate the network setup for **performance and reliability**.

## Network Design Components
### **1. SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**
- Uses an **SDN controller** (e.g., OpenDaylight, ONOS) to manage network traffic.
- Separates the **control plane** from the **data plane** for better flexibility.

### **2. NFV (Network Functions Virtualization)**
- Deploys virtualized **firewalls, VPNs, and load balancers** using **Docker/KVM**.
- Reduces reliance on **hardware-based networking devices**.

### **3. Automation**
- Uses **Python/Ansible** to automate:
  - Network provisioning
  - Configuration management
  - Traffic routing

### **4. Redundancy & High Availability**
- Implements **failover mechanisms** and **backup links**.
- Uses **load balancing** to distribute traffic and prevent single points of failure.

## Implementation Steps
### **Step 1: Setup Virtualized Environment**
- Use **GNS3, EVE-NG, or a cloud platform (AWS, Azure)**.
- Install **Docker/KVM** for virtualized services.

### **Step 2: Configure SDN Controller**
- Install **OpenDaylight/ONOS**.
- Connect network devices to the controller.

### **Step 3: Deploy NFV Services**
- Set up **virtual firewalls, VPNs, and routers**.
- Ensure **traffic policies** align with security best practices.

### **Step 4: Automate Network Configuration**
- Write **Python/Ansible scripts** for:
  - Device configuration
  - Traffic monitoring
  - Network provisioning

### **Step 5: Test & Validate**
- **Ping & Traceroute** tests for connectivity.
- **Failover simulation** to check redundancy.
- **Performance monitoring** using logs & metrics.
